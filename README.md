**Epitheca** is a mod that adds a variety of new craftable variants of existing blocks and items.  
It is currently heavily WIP, and as such, many features are not yet implemented.  
Available for download on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epitheca) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/epitheca). Thank you for over 150 downloads!   
  
  
  
To get started with the mod, simply make the Recrafter and use it to convert blocks to their Epitheca variants!
